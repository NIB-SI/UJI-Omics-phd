Therefore, in the presence of ABA, SnRK2 can phosphorylate its downstream targets, the ABA-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs) (i.e., ABF1, ABF2, ABF3, and ABF4)---nature ref 65		doi:10.1104/pp.108.129791,doi:10.3390/ijms21030819,pmid:19126699,pmid:32012796

In the presence of SA, NPR1 physically associates with JA-induced MYC2 and inhibits transcriptional activation by disrupting its interaction with MED25. In the absence of JA, JAZ cofactors competitively inhibit transcription activators of JA-responsive genes, including the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, by preventing their interaction with the MED25 subunit of the Mediator complex.

Structurally, DELLA belong to the GRAS family of transcriptional regulators, with the DELLA motif (not present in other GRAS family members). Probably acts by participating in large multiprotein complexes that repress transcription of GA-inducible genes. In contrast to RGA, it is less sensitive to GA; The protein undergoes degradation in response to GA via the 26S proteasome. GAI may be involved in reducing ROS accumulation in response to stress by up-regulating the transcription of superoxide dismutases. RGL1 may be involved in reducing ROS accumulation in response to stress by up-regulating the transcription of superoxide dismutases. Rapidly degraded in response to GA.

ARF[AT1G19850,AT2G33860,AT5G60450,AT5G62000]	PlantCoding	ARF	fc00187				ARF3 is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF. ARF4 appears to have redundant function with ETT(ARF3) in specifying abaxial cell identity. Formation of heterodimers with Aux/IAA proteins may alter their ability to modulate early auxin response genes expression. Promotes flowering, stamen development, floral organ abscission and fruit dehiscence. Functions independently of ethylene and cytokinin response pathways. May act as a repressor of cell division and organ growth.

The transcript is then cleaved at the 3’ binding site only, by AGO7. As is the case for the TAS1, TAS2, and TAS3 families, RDR6 then synthesizes the dsRNA fragment which is further processed by DCL4.

viral dsRNA	ForeignCoding						Sources of viral dsRNA for generation of visRNA: (1) In positive strand (+) RNA viruses, the genome can be directly translated into replication proteins which associate with host proteins and viral RNA to form membranous structures where the negative (−) strands are synthesized, and double-stranded replication intermediates are formed, (2) In negative strand (−) RNA viruses, transcription (relying on viral RDR) leads to the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) which can form dsRNA by pairing with the genomic RNA, (3) In negative strand (−) RNA viruses, genomic RNA replication that leads to the formation of antigenome, complementary to the genomic RNA, can base-pair with genomic RNA, serving as the source of dsRNAs (4) In DNA viruses, overlapping transcription and transcripts with self-complementary regions are sources of dsRNA,  (5) Aberrant RNAs produced due to cleavage by certain vsiRNAs, are acted upon by RDRPs1/6 to produce long dsRNAs.
