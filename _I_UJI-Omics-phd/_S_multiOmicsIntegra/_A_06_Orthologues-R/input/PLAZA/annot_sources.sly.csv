ITAG4.0	http://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome	sly	Solanum lycopersicum		Solanum lycopersicum, tomato,  is a valuable genome for several reasons. Tomatoes are of significant agricultural importance and the genome sequence can assist breeders in developing varieties with better flavor, resistance and shelf-life. But also for evolutionary studies the solanaceae are of interest as they branched of other dicots earlier than grapevine.	The tomato genome sequence provides insights into fleshy fruit evolution.	22660326	4081
